How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate file holder that a commit operates on to store a customized snapshot in the repository's history. 
	The working directory is simply the folder that contains the project irrespective of whether it is tracked by Git.
	The staging area allows the coder to track specific parts of the project rather than the all the files and folders.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	Single files can be commited rather than committing the entire repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	Branches help experiment with new features and ideas without affecting the main project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
