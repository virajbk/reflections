How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It took a lot lesser time as I didn't need to go through all the syntax in each file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would give me perspective about how the development of the program changed with respect to its goals.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can commit singular logical changes which makes checking history faster and efficient.
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Changes in one file can cause changes in other files in coding but not necessarily in other forms of content.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides a information on all commits and git diff allows us to compare them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could revert back to old commits using git checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To build an android app.
